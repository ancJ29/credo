## 1. A client's server that stops reaches no one — the machine proposes, the human places the alert; waits for a signed client (the architecture plan, 2026-10-27)

The old app counted each 5xx in its Lambda logs and posted it to a chat channel. Before the first
client goes live, something must watch the BFF and the box; the machine proposes what watches,
and where an alert lands is the human's (production).

## 2. The plan's assumptions are unmeasured — *parked* until a review (the architecture plan, 2026-10-27)

Its costs rest on about 1 M BFF calls, 23 GB and 100 ms of Lambda a call, per client a month, and
its box on c-storage holding in a `t4g.nano` with swap. The nano is read on the first box: its
memory and any OOM kill. The rest is read on the first client's first bill, with whether the BFF's
answers to CloudFront are billed.

## 3. The demo's language — *parked* until the first feature's plan (the big picture, 2026-10-27)

The 11-04 screenshots and video come from the demo, and the old app's screens came in English
and Vietnamese. Which one the demo shows, or both, is the human's call, at the first feature's
plan, since it decides each walk's words.

## 4. The network's and an environment's YAML templates — the machine writes, the human runs; built first for ridge (the architecture plan, 2026-10-27)

Home: [the ridge plan](plans/2026-10-28-ridge.md#the-templates). Hand-written CloudFormation, shipped
through change sets, in Malaysia: `ops/network.yml`, the one network (a VPC with no internet
gateway, its Instance Connect Endpoint; the S3 gateway endpoint with its first caller),
`ops/github.yml`, the account's OIDC provider for GitHub's tokens, and `ops/env.yml`, one
environment's stack (subnet, box, the role its deploys take; with piece 1 its function, bucket and
distribution). ridge is the first stack from each. A signed client's stack is one more from
`env.yml`, and still waits for a client, with its ACM certificate requested in `us-east-1` and its
name in Cloudflare.

## 5. The arm64 builds and how each release lands — the machine writes, GitHub Actions runs on the human's push to main; c-storage's first, for ridge (the architecture plan, 2026-10-27)

Home: [the ridge plan](plans/2026-10-28-ridge.md#deploys-from-github-actions). c-storage's Go binary
for arm64, built from `main` alone, sent to its box over the Instance Connect tunnel and run under
systemd. `ops/release.sh` does this, run by GitHub Actions' `deploy` job on each push to `main`, or
by the human while Actions is down. The BFF's function for arm64 comes with piece 1, in the ridge
plan's fourth layer, which decides how CD ships it.

## 6. The nightly backup and its restore — the machine writes it, the human runs it; waits for a signed client (the architecture plan, 2026-10-27)

The box's role may only put, so it cannot restore itself: the restore runs from the human's
terminal under the human's AWS session, reads a version from S3, and sends it to the box over the
Instance Connect tunnel.

The backup's copy goes through SQLite's own backup (`VACUUM INTO`, or the shell's `.backup`), or
is taken with the service stopped: a plain tarball taken mid-write can miss saves or hold a torn
file ([the c-storage memo](memo/c-storage.md#the-file-is-the-only-copy)).

ridge, the first box, holds no real data, so the backup still waits for a signed client
([the ridge plan](plans/2026-10-28-ridge.md#left-behind)). The S3 gateway endpoint and the box's
put-only role come with it.

## 7. c-storage's listener on the box's private address, not loopback — the machine; with the BFF on ridge (the app frame plan, 2026-10-27)

Home: [the ridge plan](plans/2026-10-28-ridge.md#the-listener-open-item-7). c-storage binds
`127.0.0.1` only (`Listen` in `c-storage/internal/server/server.go`, `TestListenBindsLoopbackOnly`).
The architecture puts the BFF in a Lambda that calls the box's private address
([the architecture](plans/2026-10-27-architecture.md)), which a loopback listener never answers.
ridge's first three layers reach c-storage through ssh's forward to loopback. The change therefore
waits for the first caller of the private address: the BFF on ridge, in the ridge plan's fourth
layer, with piece 1. It becomes `LISTEN_ADDR`, one IP address and never an unspecified one,
loopback when unset, with its tests. The local stack keeps loopback.

## 12. A lockfile for Bruno CLI in CI — the machine; *parked* until the CLI's dependencies are a problem (the ridge plan, step 12, 2026-10-28)

Home: [the ridge plan](plans/2026-10-28-ridge.md#deploys-from-github-actions). `npm install -g
@usebruno/cli@4.2.0` pins the CLI but not its 500-odd dependencies, and the `deploy` job runs it
beside the deploy role. The job installs with `--ignore-scripts` and runs `bru` without the job's
credentials, which holds the install scripts and the secrets. A lockfile (or a vendored install
checked by hash) would also pin the code that runs. Add it when a dependency's release breaks a
run, or when the CLI's version moves.
